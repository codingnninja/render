# Render

> Use no-build JSX and lots more in browsers and servers without a virtual DOM and tagged templates.

### Introduction

$render makes no-build JSX possible in browsers and servers without a virtual DOM or tagged template. You can now $render JavaScript components with the speed of light in script tags, and esModules.

It's intuitive, super fast and flexible. Learn more from [our docs](render-docs.vercel.app).
